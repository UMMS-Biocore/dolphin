Excel Import Guide
******************

This guide will walk you through the process of importing via the Excel Import page

Getting Started
===============

First, make sure to have an instance of dolphin available (see Dolphin Docker) as well as an account for the dolphin interface.

Once logged in, click on the 'NGS Tracking' tab on the left, then click on 'Excel Import'.

From here, under the 'Excel file input' button, there is a link to download an example excel input.  Download the example spreadsheet and you'll be ready to start adding your data.

You can also download the example spreadsheet here: 
	
	:download:`single input directory <../download/example_template.xls>`
	
	:download:`multiple input directories <../download/example_template_multi_dirs.xls>`

Filling Out the Excel File
==========================

The example spreadsheet already contains faux information to give users some context to the information they will be replacing.

Certain header cells within the spreadsheet are marked with a red arrow on the top right of the cell.  Hovering over these cells with your mouse will give you more details on what each row or column that they demark should include.

The spreadsheet contains multiple tabs that will help you organize your information properly.

If using the single input directory spreadsheet, there will not be a 'DIRS' tab within the spreadsheet.

**META-DATA:**

The first tab of the spreadsheet is the Metadata tab.  This tab will reference to specific information about the experiment series at hand.

This tab will ask for information on:

* *title:* The unique title of the Experiment Series

* *summary:* Detailed description of the goals/objectives of the Experiment Series

* *overall design:* Describe the design details of the Experiment Series

* *organization:* The organization behind the project

* *lab:* The lab within the organization

* *contributor:* First name, Initial, Last name.  You may add additional contributors by creating more 'contributor' cells in the A column with the actual contributors in the B column.

* *processed directory:* Full path for the processed output directory.  This path is where you want to keep all of the data generated.

* *amazon bucket:* Optional amazon bucket link

This is the only tab that will ask for information in a single column (column B).  The rest of the tabs will ask for information in rows.

Additionally, if using the single input directory spreadsheet, the Metadata tab will include:

* *input directory:* Full path for the input directory.  This path contains the fastq files you want to process.

Note that to add additional Imports/Samples to an already exsisting Experiment Series, the information about the experiment must be identical to that you are adding to.
Processed directory, and amazon bucket does not have to be identical for each submission.

Please note that every field except contributor and amazon bucket are required fields

**IMPORTS:**

The Imports tab will contain information about lanes/imports of the samples being submitted.

There can be multiple imports within this tab, each one residing on it's own row.

Information on imports include:

* *fragmentation method:* The fragmentation method if any.

* *strand-specific:* Is this protocol strand specific?

* *library strategy:* Sequencing techniques of this library.

Please note that protocol name is required for submission.

**SAMPLES:**

The Samples tab will contain information about the samples within the submission.

There can be multiple samples within this tab, each one residing on it's own row.

Sample information includes:

* *Sample name:* The name of the sample.

* *average insert size:* Average paired-end insert size.

* *read length:* The length of the reads.

* *Genotype:* The genotype of the sample.

* *Condition Symbol:* Symbols representing the conditions from the condition column.  Multiple condition symbols may be present if multiple conditions match the symbols and they are comma separated.

* *Condition:* Specific condition(s) pertaining to the sample.  Multiple conditions may be present as long as they are comma separated.

* *concentration:* Concentration of Conditions.

* *treatment manufacturer:* Manufacturer of treatments.

* *Donor:* Name of sample donor, Typically in the D## format.

* *Time:* Time (in minutes) post treatment.

* *Biological Replica:* Biological replica number.

Click on the 'Choose File' button to select your excel spreadsheet's path and click open.  Once your file has been selected, the file name should appear to the left of the button.

**Project Group:**

	:align: center

This section will select the group in which you would like to submit this project under.  The drop down menu should contain all of the groups that you are a member of.

If you cannot select a group, contact your local administrator or 'biocore@umassmed.edu'.

**Who can see?:**

.. image:: dolphin_pics/import_perms.png
	:align: center

This section will determine the security credentials of your submission.  You will select from one of 3 choices:

* only me
* only my group
* everyone

Your selection will determine who can see the data you will be submitting.

Submission
==========

Once you've followed these above steps, you're ready to hit the submit button.

You will be redirected to the next page where a series of checks overlook your submitted excel spreadsheet to make sure the proper information for submission was submitted.

Each tab within the spreadsheet has its own section for checks, displaying green text if the tests pass.

Yellow text is displayed with helpful information about cells that you may want to fill out, but are completely optional or able to be editted at a later point in time.

If an error occurs from improper excel spreadsheet submission, red text describing the error will appear appear in the specified section.

**Submission fails:**

.. image:: dolphin_pics/full_import_error.png
	:align: center

If your submission fails at least one of the checks in place, the data will not be submitted.

You can then edit your spreadsheet based on the error output text and resubmit the spreadsheet to try again.

**Submission passes:**

.. image:: dolphin_pics/passed_imports.png
	:align: center

If your submission passes, each section will contain green text saying that the section passed inspection.

A brief explanation describing what is being inserted/updated within the database is shown, followed by a helpful message that reads:

"We are currently processing your samples to obtain read counts and additional information.  You can check the status of these initial runs on your NGS Status page."

As stated by this message, the samples submitted are now in the initial processing step in which read counts and other additional information is obtained from the samples in order to run further analyses.

You can check the status of this initial run in the 'Run Status' page which can be found under 'NGS Tracking' on the left menu bar.
